# hello-world
github tutorial - which i may repurpose

the jenkins hello world java wont compile with maven. 
gives an error 

[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR : 
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] Source option 5 is no longer supported. Use 6 or later.
[ERROR] Target option 1.5 is no longer supported. Use 1.6 or later.

I need to do something about it. It's been a while since i did something.

let's make a jenkins pipeline work end to end.
let's make a pom file that compiles the code with no issues.
